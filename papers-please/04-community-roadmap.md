Technological Leviathan has already usurped the biggest part of our technological and scientific achivements.

Thus confronting him in a non-public manner has little chances to win. Only spreading ideas of the vital necessity of equal, free and comfortable access to the knowledge into wide layers of people can lead to the real shift.

The ultimate goal is a wide acceptance of the idea that knowledge has no master and it is much more beneficial for all of us to have freely accessible and searchable corpus of already discovered knowledge.

Putting aside dark sides of what big tech companies are doing right now, they also have democratized access to the Internet but still incapable to do it for valuable parts of knowledge corpus due to various technological and legal issues.
