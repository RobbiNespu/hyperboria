# New Conditions

We have silently crossed Rubicon. The Internet entered in our life and now it has become an integral and essential part of our lives.
It multiplied our powers and also it multiplied dangers we are put under.

## Technological Leviathan

Starting from 2010s there are rising tensions on the digital frontiers. The Internet that has been created to unite people across the world now is dissipating into divided islands. Rules of these dissected pieces are dictated by those who is hunger to manage and control for the sake of their own stability but oftenly not for the sake of who are hunger to learn and move humankind forward.

Here just a few attacks on freedom to mention:
- Great Firewall of China that is banning the entire country out of presence in the world
- US Corporations that taking responsibility of judging what is good and evil using full power of their technologies and de-facto applying laws of USA extraterritorially 
- Russia that is moving rapidly on the Chinese path in her attempts to border Internet traffic. The ultimate goal is spreading lies and propaganda inside and to outside to keep people ignorant.

Many moves that governments make means that we are considered not sane enough to live in the digital world of information. 

Is this a fate we are destined to live with?
